## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a small bit about using media queries for mobile resizing. I also for the first time did not have a design document, so I eyeballed the measurements as best I could, which I'm quite proud of.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
  .profile {
    padding: 10px;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I'm going to keep working on my abilities with media queries and how well I can recreate UI elements.
